# ui-refresh

This repository is a playground for the React compoennts compromising the new nteract UI. These components will be moved into the monorepo once they are ready for integration into the desktop app.

## Getting started

The main way to interact with this repository is through Storybook[https://storybook.js.org/]. To start Storybook, run `npm run storybook` (or `yarn storybook`). The Component workspace will run by default on port 6006. Storybook should automatically launch, but if it does not, you can view the workspace at http://localhost:6006. This functionality also is under the `start` script, instead of the default build & watch.
